# Domain Management System Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for the Domain Management System for MailEye, a cold email management application. This feature provides domain and subdomain setup, DNS configuration management, email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) validation, and reputation monitoring to ensure optimal email deliverability for cold email campaigns.

**Architecture Overview**: Next.js API routes for DNS validation, integration with domain registrar APIs, automated SPF/DKIM/DMARC record checking, and a user-friendly interface for domain configuration with real-time validation feedback.
