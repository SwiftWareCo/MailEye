# Email Account Pool Management Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for the Email Account Pool Management system for MailEye, a cold email management application. This feature manages Gmail test account creation, automated email interactions for inbox warming, and maintains a pool of email accounts that simulate positive engagement to build sender reputation.

**Architecture Overview**: Next.js API routes with Gmail API integration, automated account creation workflow, email interaction simulation engine, and secure credential management for test account pools with monitoring and analytics.

## 2. User Stories

### Pool Setup Users
