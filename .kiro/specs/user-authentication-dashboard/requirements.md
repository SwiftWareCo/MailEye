# User Authentication & Dashboard Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for the User Authentication & Dashboard system for MailEye, a cold email management application. This feature provides secure user access control and a central dashboard for managing cold email campaigns, monitoring metrics, and accessing all application functionality.

**Architecture Overview**: Next.js 15 App Router with Neon Auth for authentication, Neon PostgreSQL for user data storage with integrated auth tables, and a responsive dashboard interface built with Tailwind CSS components.

## 2. User Stories

### New Users
- **As a cold email marketer**, I want to create an account with email/password, so that I can securely access the MailEye platform
- **As a new user**, I want to verify my email address, so that my account is properly authenticated
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password if forgotten, so that I can regain access to my account

### Existing Users
- **As a registered user**, I want to log in securely, so that I can access my campaigns and data
- **As a user**, I want to stay logged in across sessions, so that I don't have to authenticate repeatedly
- **As a user**, I want to log out securely, so that my account remains protected

### Dashboard Users
- **As a user**, I want to see an overview of my campaign performance, so that I can quickly assess my email marketing success
- **As a user**, I want to navigate to different sections (campaigns, domains, monitoring), so that I can manage all aspects of my cold email operations
- **As a user**, I want to see my current plan limits and usage, so that I can understand my available resources

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Authentication Requirements
- **WHEN** a user submits a valid email/password registration, **THEN** the system **SHALL** create a new account and send email verification
- **WHEN** a user clicks email verification link, **THEN** the system **SHALL** activate their account and redirect to dashboard

### Security Requirements
- **WHEN** passwords are stored, **THEN** the system **SHALL** hash them using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
- **WHEN** sessions are created, **THEN** the system **SHALL** use secure, httpOnly cookies with CSRF protection
- **IF** suspicious login activity is detected, **THEN** the system **SHALL** require additional verification
